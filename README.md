### what is Dimension:
In physics and mathematics, the dimension of a mathematical space is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it. 
Thus a line has a dimension of one because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on it â€“ for example, the point at 5 on a number line.
