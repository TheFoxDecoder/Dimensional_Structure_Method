# Dimensional Structure Method (DSM)
## Dimensionla Volume, Area Calculation method 

### What is Dimension:
In physics and mathematics, the dimension of a mathematical space is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it. 
Thus a line has a dimension of one because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on it â€“ for example, the point at 5 on a number line.

In neural network each neuron connection base on Dimensional Structure, hypercubes also use that the connection method of DSM 
in that construction they need to track and analyze the network
